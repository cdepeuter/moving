## Using python to find an apartment in New York (or anywhere you want!)

This repo contains a python module with which I ran every minute (Ubuntu Crontask) to help get real time notifications of new apartment listings. A walkthrough of the code is in streetEasy.ipynb and the actual python module is in find_apy.py. It won't work out of the box as you'll have to update the email accounts/passwords in sendMail().
